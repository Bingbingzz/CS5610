        <h2>Courses took so far:</h2>
        <ul lass="course-plan">
            <li>CS5001:  Intensive Foundations of Computer Science</li>
            <p>Introduces systematic problem solving through programming. Offers students an 
                opportunity to learn how to analyze a problem, how to divide and organize the problem into 
                appropriate components, how to describe the problem in a computer language, how to analyze 
                and understand the behavior of their programs, and how to test that their programs are working
                    correctly. Additionally, introduces a method of program design called object-oriented programming
                    and various ways to organize data, including a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages. 
                    To practice the course concepts, students undertake assignments ranging from small, highly 
                    specified programming tasks to larger open-ended problems where students design and code their 
                    own solutions.</p>

            <li>CS5002: Discrete Structures</li>
                <p>Introduces the mathematical structures and methods that form the foundation of computer science. 
                    Studies structures such as sets, tuples, sequences, lists, trees, and graphs. Discusses functions, 
                    relations, ordering, and equivalence relations. Examines inductive and recursive definitions of 
                    structures and functions. Covers principles of proof such as truth tables, inductive proof, and basic
                     logic and the counting techniques and arguments needed to estimate the size of sets, the growth of 
                     functions, and the space-time complexity of algorithms. Also, discusses data structures such as arrays,
                      stacks, queues, lists, and the algorithms that manipulate them.</p>

            <li>CS5004: Object-Oriented Design</li>
            <p>Presents a comparative approach to object-oriented programming and design. Discusses the concepts of object, 
                class, metaclass, message, method, inheritance, and genericity. Reviews forms of polymorphism in object-oriented
                 languages. Contrasts the use of inheritance and composition as dual techniques for software reuse—forwarding vs.
                  delegation and subclassing vs. subtyping. Offers students an opportunity to obtain a deeper understanding of the 
                  principles of object-oriented programming and design, including software components, object-oriented design patterns,
                   and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified modeling language). Illustrates basic concepts in 
                   object-oriented design with case studies in application frameworks and by writing programs in Java.</p>

            <li>CS5008:  Data Structures, Algorithms, and Their Applications within Computer Systems</li>
            <p>Presents an integrated approach to the study of data structures, algorithms, and their application within systems topics.
                 Introduces a variety of fundamental algorithmic techniques (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, graph algorithms) 
                 and systems topics (models of computation, computer architecture, compilation, system software, networking). Demonstrates
                  the integration of topics through programming assignments in the C language that implement fundamental data structures 
                  (lists, queues, trees, maps, graphs) and algorithms as they are applied in computer systems. Additional breadth topics 
                  include programming applications that expose students to primitives of different subsystems using threads and sockets.</p>
            
            <li>CS5610: Web Development</li>
            <p>Discusses Web development for sites that are dynamic, data driven, and interactive. Focuses on the software development issues
                 of integrating multiple languages, assorted data technologies, and Web interaction. Considers ASP.NET, C#, HTTP, HTML, CSS, 
                 XML, XSLT, JavaScript, AJAX, RSS/Atom, SQL, and Web services. Each student must deploy individually designed Web experiments 
                 that illustrate the Web technologies and at least one major integrative Web site project. Students may work in teams with the 
                 permission of the instructor. Each student or team must also create extensive documentation of their goals, plans, design decisions, 
                 accomplishments, and user guidelines. All source files must be open and be automatically served by a sources server.</p>
            
             <li>CS5200: Database Management Systems</li>
             <p>Introduces relational database management systems as a class of software systems. Prepares students to be sophisticated users of 
                database management systems. Covers design theory, query language, and performance/tuning issues. Topics include relational algebra,
                 SQL, stored procedures, user-defined functions, cursors, embedded SQL programs, client-server interfaces, entity-relationship diagrams,
                  normalization, B-trees, concurrency, transactions, database security, constraints, object-relational DBMSs, and specialized engines 
                  such as spatial, text, XML conversion, and time series. Includes exercises using a commercial relational or object-relational database
                   management system. </p>

            <li>CS5800: Algorithms</li>
            <p>Presents the mathematical techniques used for the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Focuses on algorithmic design paradigms and 
                techniques for analyzing the correctness, time, and space complexity of algorithms. Topics may include asymptotic notation, recurrences, 
                loop invariants, Hoare triples, sorting and searching, advanced data structures, lower bounds, hashing, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, 
                graph algorithms, and NP-completeness.</p>
